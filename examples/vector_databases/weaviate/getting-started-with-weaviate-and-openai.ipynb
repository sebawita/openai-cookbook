    "# Using Vector Databases for Embeddings Search\n",
    "\n",
    "/// TODO: update this text\n",
    "This notebook takes you through a simple flow to download some data, embed it, and then index and search it using a selection of vector databases. This is a common requirement for customers who want to store and search our embeddings with their own data in a secure environment to support production use cases such as chatbots, topic modelling and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a Vector Database\n",
    "\n",
    "A vector database is a database made to store, manage and search embedding vectors. The use of embeddings to encode unstructured data (text, audio, video and more) as vectors for consumption by machine-learning models has exploded in recent years, due to the increasing effectiveness of AI in solving use cases involving natural language, image recognition and other unstructured forms of data. Vector databases have emerged as an effective solution for enterprises to deliver and scale these use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why use a Vector Database\n",
    "\n",
    "Vector databases enable enterprises to take many of the embeddings use cases we've shared in this repo (question and answering, chatbot and recommendation services, for example), and make use of them in a secure, scalable environment. Many of our customers make embeddings solve their problems at small scale but performance and security hold them back from going into production - we see vector databases as a key component in solving that, and in this guide we'll walk through the basics of embedding text data, storing it in a vector database and using it for semantic search.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Demo Flow\n",
    "The demo flow is:\n",
    "- **Prerequisites Setup**: Create a Weaviate instance and install required libraries\n",
    "- **Connect**: Connect to your Weaviate instance \n",
    "- **Schema Configuration**: Configure the schema of your data\n",
    "    - *Note*: Here we can define which OpenAI Embedding Model to use\n",
    "    - *Note*: Here we can configure which properties to index on\n",
    "- **Import data**: Load a demo dataset and import it into Weaviate\n",
    "    - *Note*: The import process will automatically index your data - based on the configuration in the schema\n",
    "    - *Note*: You don't need to explicitly vectorize your data, Weaviate will communicate with OpenAI to do it for you.\n",
    "- **Run Queries**: Query \n",
    "    - *Note*: You don't need to explicitly vectorize your queries, Weaviate will communicate with OpenAI to do it for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you've run through this notebook you should have a basic understanding of how to setup and use vector databases, and can move on to more complex use cases making use of our embeddings."

    "# Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we start this project, we need setup the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* create a `Weaviate` instance\n",
    "* install the `weaviate-client` and `datasets`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Create a Weaviate instance\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a Weaviate instance we have 2 options:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. (Recommended path) [Weaviate Cloud Service](https://console.weaviate.io/) – to host your Weaviate instance in the cloud. The free sandbox should be more than enough for this cookbook.\n",
    "2. Install and run Weaviate locally with Docker.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Option 1 – WCS Installation Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "Use [Weaviate Cloud Service](https://console.weaviate.io/) (WCS) to create a free Weaviate cluster.\n",
    "1. create a free account and/or login to [WCS](https://console.weaviate.io/)\n",
    "2. create a `Weaviate Cluster` with the following settings:\n",
    "    * Sandbox: `Sandbox Free`\n",
    "    * Weaviate Version: Use default (latest)\n",
    "    * OIDC Authentication: `Disabled`\n",
    "3. your instance should be ready in a minute or two\n",
    "4. make a note of the `Cluster Id`. The link will take you to the full path of your cluster (you will need it later to connect to it). It should be something like: `https://your-project-name.weaviate.network` \n",
    "\n",
    "### Option 2 – local Weaviate instance with Docker\n",
    "\n",
    "Install and run Weaviate locally with Docker.\n",
    "1. Get the [./docker-compose.yml](./docker-compose.yml) file\n",
    "2. Then start docker with \n",
    "```bash\n",
    "docker-compose up -d \n",
    "```\n",
    "Once this is ready, your instance should be available at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> To shut down, you can call:\n",
    ">```bash\n",
    ">docker-compose down\n",
    ">```\n",
    "\n",
    "To learn more, about using Weaviate with Docker see the [installation documentation](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/installation/docker-compose).\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "## Install required libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "Before running this project make sure to have the following libraries:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Weaviate Python Client\n",
    "\n",
    "The [Weaviate Python Client](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/client-libraries/python) allows you to communicate with your Weaviate instance from your Python project.\n",
    "\n",
    "To install the Python client, run the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "pip install weaviate-client\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "The datasets library is used to load the sample dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you don't have the datasets library, run the following command:\n",
    "\n",

      "Church (building)\n",
      "A church is a building that was constructed to allow people to meet to worship together. These people are usually Christians, or influenced by Christianity. Some other non-Christian religious groups also call their religious buildings churches, most notably Scientology.\n",
      "\n",
      "The following description is about Roman Catholic churches, although some parts are the same in Episcopalian and Lutheran churches. Depending on the number of people that are in a community, the churches come in different sizes. Small churches are called chapels. The churches in a particular geographical area form a group called the diocese.  Each diocese has a cathedral.  In most cases, the cathedral is a very big church. Cathedrals are the seat of bishops.\n",
      "\n",
      "History of church buildings \n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "In the early days of Christianity people had to worship in secret. Christian worship was not allowed in the Roman empire, so Christians had to meet in a secret place. Sometimes they met in people’s houses or barns, sometimes they met underground. The first places that were built for Christian worship were small chapels that were cut into a rock where people could worship without being discovered.\n",
      "\n",
      "After the death of the Roman emperor Constantine in 337 A.D. Christians were allowed to have buildings to worship in. These first churches were built on a similar plan to Roman basilicas. This plan was later used for the fine Gothic cathedrals and churches that were built at the end of the Middle Ages.\n",
      "\n",
      "The parts of a church \n",
      "\n",
      "There are several parts in the architecture of a church. Not all churches will have all these parts:\n",
      "\n",
      " The nave is the main part of the church where the congregation (the people who come to worship) sit. \n",
      " The aisles are the sides of the church which may run along the side of the nave.\n",
      " The transept, if there is one, is an area which crosses the nave near the top of the church. This makes the church shaped like a cross, which is a symbol of Jesus's death on a cross.\n",
      " The chancel leads up to the altar at the top of the church. The altar is in the sanctuary. The word “sanctuary” means “sacred place”. People were not allowed to be arrested in the sanctuary, so they were safe. The altar is usually at the east end of the church. People in the church sit facing the altar. We say that the church “faces east”.\n",
      " Churches will also have a tower or steeple, usually at the west end. If the church has a transept the tower may be above the centre of the transept.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Roman Catholic churches there is always a stoup (bowl) of holy water near the entrance of the church. This tradition comes from the fact that Roman basilicas had a fountain for washing in front of the entrance. The font is a bowl where people (often babies) are baptized. This is also near the entrance of the church. This is a symbol of the fact that it is welcoming the people into the Christian church.\n",
      "\n",
      "Traditionally the nave has long benches for the congregation to sit on. These are called pews. Some churches may now have replaced their pews with chairs so that they can be moved about for different occasions. At the front of the nave is the pulpit where the priest preaches (these talks are called “sermons”). There is also a lectern (like a large music stand) from where the lessons (the Bible readings) are read.\n",
      "\n",
      "If there are aisles along the side of the nave there will be pillars which hold up the roof. In large churches or cathedrals there may be a row of little arches along the top of these pillars. This is called the triforium. Over the triforium is the clerestory which is a row of windows high up in the church wall.\n",
      "\n",
      "The chancel is the most holy part of the church, and this is why it is often separated from the nave by a screen which can be made of wood or stone, or occasionally iron. The congregation can see through the screen. On the top of the screen there may be a cross. This is called a rood (pronounce like “rude”) screen. Priests used to climb up a staircase to the top of the rood screen to read the epistle and the gospel. Sometimes people sang from there.\n",
      "\n",
      "Inside the chancel are the benches where the choir sit. These are called choir stalls. They are on both sides. The two sides of the choir sit facing one another. The choir members who sit on the left (north side) are called “cantoris” (the side where the “cantor” sits) and those on the right (south side) are called “decani” (the side where the deacon sits). In some large churches or cathedrals the seats for the priests tip up. The top of these seats, when they are tipped up, are called misericords (from the Latin word for “mercy”). This is because the priests or monks were able to lean against them when they got tired if they had to stand up for a long time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sometimes there are holes in the walls of the screen so that the congregation can see through. These are called squints. If there is a recess in the wall it is called an aumbry. It is a cupboard for communion wine and bread that have been consecrated by a priest.\n",
      "\n",
      "The altar may be right at the east end of the church, but in larger churches or cathedrals it is often much farther forward. In that case the very east end is called an apse. Sometimes it is a separate chapel called the “Lady Chapel”.\n",
      "\n",
      "Churches through the ages \n",
      "\n",
      "The design of churches changed a lot during the course of history. Often churches were made bigger. When this happened there may be a mixture of architectural styles. These styles vary a lot in different countries.\n",
      "\n",
      "English churches \n",
      "\n",
      "In English churches there were several different periods of architecture:\n",
      "\n",
      " The Saxon period (700–1050) was a time when churches were very simple. The end of the church (end of the sanctuary) was often rounded. Hardly any are left now because they were mostly made of wood.\n",
      " The Norman period (1050–1190) came from the style called Romanesque which was popular in Europe. The arches had ornaments which were called “mouldings”. The tops of the pillars looked like cushions, so they were called “cushion capitals”. The windows were narrow and rounded at the top.\n",
      " Early English or Gothic architecture (1190–1280) was not as solid and heavy as Norman architecture. Towers were elegant and tall, like the tower of Salisbury Cathedral.\n",
      " The Decorated style of architecture (1280–1360)was popular at a time when the plague (Black Death) was raging and a third of the people in England died. For that reason, not so much building was done then. There were lots of stone carvings were made in churches at that time.\n",
      " The Perpendicular style (1360–1540) was very grand. It had lots of straight upward lines and fan vaulting. This can be seen in Westminster Abbey and King's College Chapel, Cambridge. Many churches that can be seen in England were built in this period.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the 1600s, churches were built in a variety of styles. Often they copied some of the older styles. After the Great Fire of London many new churches were built by the architect Sir Christopher Wren. They were built in the classical style. Churches continued to be built in later centuries like this, but also the Gothic style continued to be used.\n",
      "\n",
      "Modern churches often do not have the traditional cross-shape. It is difficult for the congregation to see and hear what is happening in the chancel. Modern churches bring the congregation, choir and priests in closer touch. An example is the round design for the Church of Christ the Cornerstone in Milton Keynes. Modern churches are often simpler but with a warmer character than the Gothic churches. Many have beautiful mosaic glass windows. Coventry Cathedral is a famous example of a modern church building.\n",
